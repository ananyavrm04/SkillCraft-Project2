In this project , I have implemented a K-means Clustering algorithm to group customers of retail store based on their purchase history.
This project aimed to better understand customer behaviour and tailor marketing stratigies accordingly.
Tools & Libraries that were used are - Python , Scikit-Learn,Pandas and matplotlib.
Utilized the elbow method to determine the optimized number of clusters for effective segmentation.
